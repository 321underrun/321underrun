<!---Hi, first I am very sorry because I am not a developer or tech engineer. I came across OVLP trying to solve another problem searching YouTube. I do appreciate the care for the environment by you all creating a way
To extend the life of computers which delays them going to some dump. I did the upgrade of OS X El Capitan to macOS 10 and then to macOS 12. Everything went very will-the instructions sheet along with watching a video on YouTube 
at the same time. However, I did get one major problem: for some reason I now cannot copy to, drag n'drop or anything with my MacPro Book hard drive. The macOS Monterey will let me open it up and that's all. I can put old files from 
external hard drives or thumb drives....but nothing to my hard drive. Can you help me please? Thank you in advance for your time and consideration!
